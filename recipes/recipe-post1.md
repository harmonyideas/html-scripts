1. Place all the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix until well-combined. Knead by hand or in a mixer for about 5 minutes until you have a smooth, soft dough.

2. Place the dough aside and allow to rest (about 30min) in a covered bowl.  Prepare the solution by boiling the water in a large pot and mixing the baking soda until fully dissolved.  

3. Set the solution aside and allow to cool to about lukeworm temperature.

4. Preheat the oven to about 450F.  Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

5. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and allow to rest for about 5 min.

6. Roll each piece into the shape of a mini pizza pie and place the cheese and pepperoni toppings in the center.

7. Fold the dough into a tight ball and make sure there are no openings for the toppings to seep out.

8. Place each pizza ball into the solution making sure to submerge the entire ball.

9. Allow pizza balls to dry for about 5 min. and apply the egg wash.

10. Bake the pretzels for about 12 - 15 min.
